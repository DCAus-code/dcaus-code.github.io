  <h1>Important Message for Community Members</h1>
  <p>Dear All Den Mothers</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, we regret to inform you that the " &gt;IP" <strong>command is no longer available</strong> on our Discord server. We have received threats from Discord and some Law Enforcement Agencies, which has resulted in the bot being taken offline.</p>
  <p>We understand that this command was useful for our community members, but we had to take this decision to ensure the safety and security of our server. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and we are working tirelessly to find a solution.</p>
  <p>If you have any urgent matters or concerns, please feel free to contact our support team, who will be more than happy to assist you.</p>
  <p>Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in this matter.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <p>Dan</p>
