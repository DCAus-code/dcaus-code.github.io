    <p>We are locking up every text and voice channel for right now on the server due to some technical difficulties with the Discord API. The moderation bot will need to come back online for the chats to be unlocked again. We are sorry for the inconvenience. We are working our asses off to get the bot back. Thanks - Dan</p>
    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
    <p>I hope this message finds you well. As you may already know, we have been experiencing some technical difficulties with the Discord API, which has led us to lock up every text and voice channel on the server for the time being. This is a temporary measure that we have had to take to ensure the safety and security of our community.</p>
    <p>Our moderation bot is currently offline, which means that we are unable to monitor the chats effectively. Therefore, we have decided to lock the channels until we can bring the bot back online. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, and we want to assure you that we are working tirelessly to resolve this issue as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>We understand how important it is for our community members to communicate with each other, and we are doing everything in our power to restore the functionality of our server. In the meantime, if you have any urgent matters or concerns, please feel free to contact our support team, who will be more than happy to assist you.</p>
    <p>Once again, we apologize for the inconvenience, and we appreciate your patience and understanding while we work to resolve this issue. We will keep you updated on the progress, and we hope to have the bot back online soon.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your understanding,</p>
    <p>Dan and the rest of the team.</p><div class="page-body">
