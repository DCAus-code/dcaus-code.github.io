    <h1>Apology from Fritz</h1>

    <p>Hello internet, I am writing this post to sincerely apologize for recent actions and posts that may have caused offense or harm. I acknowledge my mistakes and want to address and rectify them.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>I should not have posted my personal life, disagreements, arguments, etc. That is dumb of me because it does start drama and defamation if I should call it that. I do apologize for that.</p>

        <p>I apologize to @__camburger__ for revealing our DMs, Blocks, Problems, etc. I should not have done that and I do apologize.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>As for the controversy surrounding a Real IP grabber and the logo's copyright, I want to clarify that the IP grabber was fake and meant as a joke. The logo has been filed via <a href="http://copyright.gov" target="_blank">copyright.gov</a>, and therefore it is indeed copyrighted. I take full accountability for any misunderstandings and overreactions.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Hello internet, I know I have recently started to "shift" the ways I'm posting things, perhaps posting controversial content. I apologize for any offense to anyone affected, and those posts have been deleted. I promise nothing like that will happen again.</p>
        <p>I want to apologize for my actions once again because what I did, said, or depicted was wrong of me. I will do better and take the backlash. Thank you, internet, for forgiving me. If you have any advice, questions, or anything in between, then reply to this comment.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your understanding and patience. I am committed to learning from these mistakes and ensuring a more positive and respectful online presence in the future.</p>
